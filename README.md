# status

The basic concept and the structure of the website are roughly set: the footer and all the secondary pages are still missing.
Working on the JS features: The first feature will be a night/dark mode button. The button has been added, first as notmal button. Today, 28.02, as icon. I added the moon icon first as an svg-image, still to see in the code but commented out, and then as a font. Till today I didn't know pretty nothing about icons.

Resources I consulted to design the botton:

- https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_icon_buttons.asp but at the end I didn't use it and I didn't explore the the [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) thing.

- The first icon I used was this one: https://iconscout.com/icon/night-mode-3#
- Then I followed this styling guide: https://moderncss.dev/icon-button-css-styling-guide/ and https://moderncss.dev/css-button-styling-guide/ - that gave me the idea of the round background for the icon.
- Then I started to read about icon fonts. And I'm still not sure if [icon fonts are awesome](https://css-tricks.com/examples/IconFont/) or if you better [don't use them](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/seriously-dont-use-icon-fonts/)!
- I ended up using them - browsing [this list](https://css-tricks.com/flat-icons-icon-fonts/)
- The actual moon I used is taken here: https://www.alessioatzeni.com/meteocons/ but since the downlaod link was not working I found the same library in [icomoon](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select/library), that seems to be a cool thing.
